# Computational resources  

## Wynton <img src="./images/wynton.png" width="20" />  
Wynton is a large, shared high performance computer cluster that is available to all UCSF members. If your work is too large to run on your own laptop or would benefit from a highly parallelized workload, Wynton should be used.

## Aragorn <img src="./images/aragorn.png" width="20" />  
Aragorn is a moderately powerful desktop computer housed in our lab (built in 2014) that can be used for small workloads. Generally, if you can run it on your relatively new laptop but don't want to tie up using your computer, Aragorn is a good alternative. However, it is limited in its ability, and should only really be used for short term usage. Longer term jobs (up to 2 weeks) should be run on Wynton. 

- How to access Aragorn/theMines   Who to ask for account R Studio?
  - At least one member should be responsible (ie. an admin) for Aragorn, in charge of adding users. 
  - For now ask our Bioinformatician, Brian Palmer

## The Mines ⛰️

The Mines are our network attached storage (NAS), essentially a small server with a very large amount of storage (~60 tb). Used for long term storage of raw data. Data is backed up nightly to an offsite location. 

## Nextflow <img src="./images/nextflow.png" width="20" />  
Nextflow is a workflow language that can generate job submissions for many HPC scheduler platforms. Recommended for production level pipelines. An example is Sun Grid Engine, the scheduler currently used by Wynton HPC (Jan 2023). More information about Nextflow on their [website](https://www.nextflow.io/). Example pipelines can be found under the EPPIcenter Organization on [GitHub](https://github.com/EPPIcenter) or at [nf-co.re](https://nf-co.re/). 

## Installing software  
If you are using a shared resource, you will find that there are issues with insufficient privileges to install at the site level. You should instead install binaries locally. One package manager that is recommended is [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) or [miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).  Conda environment/ best practices (link somewhere) 

## Github <img src="./images/github.png" width="20" />
A code repository where members of the EPPIcenter store pipelines, tools and analysis. GitHub enables collaboration and sharing projects under the [EPPIcenter organization](https://github.com/EPPIcenter). Members are recommended to create a GitHub account and request access from one of the organization admins.

## Docker Hub <img src="./images/docker.png" width="20" />
A repository for docker images, to store and share custom images. A user that needs access to the image can easily [pull](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/) the image from the repository. Another use case is configuring nextflow to use docker, which will automatically pull a specified image. To learn more, please refer to the [docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/).

## Stack Overflow for Teams <img src="./images/stackoverflow.png" width="20" /> 
A knowledge sharing [platform](https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/eppicenter/questions) for EPPIcenter questions and answers.  Users are encouraged to post questions, tutorials, and answers.  Additionally, when a user is stuck on a particular problem, they can search through the EPPIcenter Stack Overflow to seek a solution to their particular problem.
