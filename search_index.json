[["index.html", "EPPIcenter Lab Handbook Welcome 0.1 Mission 0.2 Vision 0.3 People 0.4 Environment 0.5 Expectations", " EPPIcenter Lab Handbook Welcome The EPPIcenter is a program based within the Division of HIV, ID and Global Medicine at UCSF, dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of infectious disease transmission. 0.1 Mission We aim to advance the understanding of infectious diseases to reduce global morbidity and mortality through a systems epidemiology approach that links pipettes to populations by integrating state-of-the-art data collection, molecular technologies, and computational analysis. 0.2 Vision This highly collaborative, interdisciplinary program will catalyze understanding of complex infectious disease dynamics. We will decode and synthesize data from the field and the bench using novel computational models. Working closely with global health agencies, we will produce actionable insight into optimal targeting of interventions, advancing beyond what can be achieved by traditionally compartmentalized efforts and leading to more rapid reductions in infectious disease burden and eventual elimination. The Center will thus be positioned as a global leader in the fight against malaria, arboviruses, and other globally important infectious diseases, providing training opportunities and producing valuable resources (e.g.¬†software, seminars, educational workshops) for the greater University and international community. As a program, we have two equally important goals: Advance the understanding of infectious diseases by performing high-quality research Create a collaborative environment that accelerates the growth of scientists and improves the practice of science Performing high-quality research means that we undertake meaningful problems, investigate them in a rigorous way, and promptly publish our results so that others can easily pick up where we leave off. Creating an environment that promotes the growth of scientists means that we support the expansion of our own and one another‚Äôs research capacities, especially through persistent effort, curiosity, and constructive criticism. 0.3 People The EPPIcenter consist of faculty, trainees, and staff dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of infectious disease dynamics. Each trainee/staff member may work primarily with one or multiple faculty members, but we encourage collaboration among all members of the program. Each faculty will have specific expectations in their respective research group. However, all faculty share core values around the work environment we want to build. 0.4 Environment Our environment is one which nurtures a culture of curiosity, personal growth, scientific inquiry and collaboration. This means bringing your whole self to work, with a hard but sustainable work ethic. Good science comes from open discussion and respectful debate - challenge others, and do it in a way that communicates mutual support and respect, appreciating the luxury that you get to work with others who have different viewpoints and backgrounds. Be open to collaboration; research is more productive and fun when multiple people are involved and engaged. Ask for help, be ready to provide help, and be careful about appropriately acknowledging contributions from others. Most importantly, have fun! If you are not enjoying what you do, let‚Äôs discuss why and how we can change that. 0.5 Expectations Recognize that everyone regardless of job title is here to learn and wants to grow. Be good members of our communities, both scientific and geographic. Feel comfortable reaching out to PIs or others in the group if you feel something could be improved, or if you feel like something inappropriate (scientific, organizationally, or interpersonal) may be going on. Spend our time and the funds of our supporters wisely. Read the literature continuously to become an expert on areas you are working on. This is true for everyone in the lab, and particularly for graduate students and postdocs. Attendance of all EPPIcenter meetings and respective lab meetings (preference for in person attendance). We adhere to the principles of open science - sharing code, protocols, methods, data, and results. Specifically we expect all publications to be submitted to a preprint server like bioRxiv as soon and freely as you can accurately and ethically do so. We promote the submission of all research to open access journals. We expect a high degree of rigor and reproducibility in all aspects of data generation and analysis. Published work should be accompanied with the code and data necessary for reproducibility. We recommend sharing this information on a GitHub repository with software developed in the lab will reside on the EPPIcenter GitHub repository.

About 24 hours prior to your start date, Human Resources will send a long email that explains how to access your UCSF email &amp; calendar (your UCSF identity). They will not activate these until midnight. The same email has instructions for both UCSF &amp; ZSFG badges, and building access. Follow their instructions to request your ZSFG badging letter. Pick up the letter and walk it to the ZSFG badging office. There are several housekeeping items to take care of. Send updated bio for lab website, including a photo and your preferred pronouns to Teresa. After accessing your UCSF email, you can start online trainings. They differ depending on your role. There are trainings required by UCSF and another set required by ZSFG. Post docs, fellows &amp; faculty: Update your UCSF profile when it becomes viable. Login to UCPath for health insurance (1st 30 days), tax withholdings, benefits, direct deposit, address. Depending on your role, you may need to submit a timesheet every two weeks or every month.

We must adhere to both the UCSF and ZSFG guidelines If you have respiratory symptoms, stay home, self test, or visit an occupational health recommended site Testing resources available at UCSF: https://coronavirus.ucsf.edu/testing Report a COVID-19 infection to Occupational Health Services through this link or call 628-206-4100 1.2 EPPIcenter Meetings üìÖ There are several standing meetings on your Outlook calendar. Meetings specific to your role will also be added. Everyone attends the Friday EPPIcenter lab meeting, the Tuesday Malaria Meeting, and the monthly EPPIcenter seminar. Project specific meetings and 1:1 meetings with PIs may be standing, or scheduled as needed depending on PI‚Äôs preference. Friday EPPIcenter lab meeting Schedule. We prefer you attend in-person. At the moment we share lunch (provided) on the 2nd Friday of the month. After announcements (abstract deadlines, events, new papers), a rotating subset of people will provide a 1-5 minute update on their research (and life, if they‚Äôd like!). Then the person assigned to present that day will discuss a research project or a paper for 40-45 minutes. Announce papers early in the week to allow everyone to read and critically think about the paper. Monthly EPPIcenter Seminar Series All are expected to attend. These are curated experiences that bring you in contact with leaders in their field. The typical format is an hour-long talk (open to the general public) followed by 30 minutes of Q&amp;A (closed to our lab only). As an example‚ÄîTrevor Bedford kicked off the series before COVID made him famous. Bay Area Malaria Meeting Schedule. Brings you in contact with malaria researchers across multiple UCSF campuses and institutions. Convenes alternate Tuesdays. Wetlab meeting Meets 9:30-10:30am Mondays to set the agenda for the week for wetlab projects. wetlab working doc. Bioinformatics meeting Wednesday at 2pm. This meeting is run by the bioinformaticians, attended by interested post-docs and PIs. It is a weekly meeting to update the progress made on various projects and to troubleshoot issues that have come up. Agenda: here Lo Lab meeting Every two weeks, typically Monday 10am every two weeks. Comprised of announcements and updates, followed by a presentation on a paper or some work in progress. 1.3 Lab Communication Each PI may have different preferences for their primary mode of communication, please check with your supervisor. Members should add vacation/out days on the EPPIcenter Google calendar, so the group can plan. Slack is the primary mode of communication for the larger EPPIcenter group, and the best tool for announcements and discussions. We are able to add collaborators as single-channel users, to hold discussions with a wider group. Asana is our primary tool for project management. You may be assigned tasks in Asana if your supervisor prefers. Slack We love EPPIcenter slack!! We use it a lot. Please review best practices. Please do not create new direct message groups unless absolutely necessary; use a channel and include everyone involved. There is a ‚Äú#where‚Äù channel on Slack, which is mostly for post-docs and PIs to let the team know when they will not be in person. If you are working from home, you do not have to tell us where you are or why you are working from home in the #where channel; we expect you to stay in contact with project leads, and we trust you to complete your work. If you would prefer to let people know, go ahead! UCSF Box Where we keep and share files securely. Access it at My Access. Download the Box Drive application to your device. It will save you headaches later. Ask Teresa to invite you to EPPIadmin. There are other folders specific to different projects (PRISM, Serology etc..) You may need to remind your teammates that you need access. Zoom Download the zoom app to your desktop. Login to your UCSF zoom account on My Access and set up your personal zoom room. Add your link to our zoom rooms. 1.3.1 Communicating and meeting with Bryan One-on-one and small group meetings One-on-one and small group meetings related to projects are a valuable time to review your progress, discuss next steps, and discuss how I can best continue to support you. To make these meetings the most productive for both of us, please follow these principles. Come to each meeting prepared with an agenda. This can be in the form of slides, a text document, or another format, but should clearly communicate what your goals were since our last meeting, what you have worked on towards each of those goals, and what your plans are next. Focus your agenda on the areas I can help you, and have specific questions prepared for us to discuss. This will be a better use of your time than reviewing everything you have done since our last meeting. These meetings are a great time to share results and discuss them together. For any figures (or other results) you are showing me or others, make sure you can communicate why you made the figure, what you did, and what you think it means even if you are not sure. Please have all results generated in advance and put into a slideshow or other document. Feel free to prioritize the key results and have additional ones you‚Äôve made set aside in case we want to review. Generating figures in real time (e.g.¬†sharing your R console as you run code) should be reserved for additional questions that come up during our discussion, if at all. Document what we discuss. In particular, make sure you have a clear idea about next steps. If you are unsure about any action items at the end of our meeting or thereafter, please clarify with me. One-on-one meetings are also a good time to discuss career goals and development. These discussions should happen at least a few times per year, and you are welcome to bring up these topics at our meetings more frequently. When you do, add them to your agenda and consider starting with them so they are allotted appropriate time for discussion. General Communications Slack is my preferred mode for routine, asynchronous communication. I usually check and respond to Slack messages within a few hours during work days unless I am on vacation, traveling, or have a particularly limited schedule. If I haven‚Äôt responded within 24 hours feel free to message me again. If you need to reach me during times I am not checking Slack or if something is particularly timely, please text me at 415-317-2263. If you send or forward me an email that I should read and I haven‚Äôt responded within 48 hours, please let me know about the email via Slack or text message (depending on whether I am traveling). To schedule a meeting with me, first check my availability on Outlook calendar and then Slack me to confirm a time. Early to mid afternoon is generally my preferred time for meetings that do not involve other time zones. For group meetings, I have found when2meet to work well. 1.4 Ordering &amp; Reimbursements (EPPIcard and MyExpense) MyExpense Instructions for reimbursement. You need the speedchart (pinned in Slack #ordering) Edward Wiedemann is the approver for most grants. Add him to your account settings before start. To charge another PI‚Äôs grants, you need approver‚Äôs name and the full chartstring (not just speedchart) Use the SAP concur app, and set up direct email forwarding of receipts to Concur. Alcohol is difficult to get reimbursed; keep it on a separate receipt when possible. Reimbursement in UCSF is complicated. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help. EPPIcard when a speedchart won‚Äôt work. Get PI or Teresa‚Äôs approval. Details pinned in #ordering. Immediately record in EPPIcard Put receipt in Box EPPIcard invoices. Do NOT use for travel (flights, hotels, or conf fees) Travel ‚úàÔ∏è Work travel includes travel for conferences and for on-site research supervision or training. There are two options for booking flights, through Connexus/UC Travel office (which charges a speedtype and automatically enrolls you in travel insurance) or on your own credit card with reimbursement after the trip ends. If the trip is being charged to a federal grant, you may be required to use a US Carrier depending on where you are flying: Fly America Act. You can use codeshare flights like Delta/KLM. If you book your flight independently, you must register for UC Travel insurance: register. Request a travel cash advance, and keep records of what you spend. Photo your receipts and forward them to My expense, either by email or through the Concur App. Our approver is Edward Wiedemann. Avoid paying other people‚Äôs expenses while traveling (lodging, food). It makes the reimbursement process more difficult. Alcohol is almost never reimbursable; put it on a separate receipt, or you will have to allocate the receipts to indicate that those items are personal expenses. International travel: Be sure to get UCSF travel approval, you will need it to get reimbursed. You need necessary vaccines, and get your visa ahead of time. Get malaria prophylaxis if you are traveling to an endemic country. Double check the dates on your visa once you get it to make sure you are not turned away at the airport. Make sure to register for UC Travel insurance. Other travel resources can be found here (link to additional stuff below) Rules depend on funding. A good guide. Best UCSF guide. Ed Wiedemann knows specifics for your grant Book flights thru Connexus or UC Travel office. This uses a speedchart and enrolls you in the insurance. If you use your credit card for flight manually register for travel insurance (UC policy). Federal grants use a US carrier (Fly America Act) (Delta/KLM is OK, book through Delta not KLM) Request a cash advance in MyExpense if needed. Email budget to approver and have PI email approval. Make sure your immunizations are appropriate. Some take more than 1 shot, spaced apart. Laptop: get a UCSF IT note saying the UCSF encryption software is legal if you are traveling to a country where customs examines computers for encryption. For travel to Uganda, you do not need this. It is possible to link your Uber account to MyExpense.

When in doubt, check with co-workers. The main area is called Pre-PCR (main lab in Bldg 3). This space is dedicated to storage and processing of samples (e.g.¬†blood, swabs) and is free of amplification products. Processing of samples includes reorganization, extraction of nucleic acids or other macromolecules, reactions that do not involve DNA amplification, and mixing amplification reactions prior to amplification. We also have an XNA-free (nucleic acid free) room. No samples containing XNA (blood, swabs, etc), or extracted XNA are allowed in this room, the only exception are short oligos/primers. The XNA-free room has a PCR Workstation where mixing of reagents must be performed. No open reagent tubes are allowed in the benches in this room; all work must be done in the Workstation. Our PCR room is located in Bldg 100. Any PCR or other XNA amplification reactions need to be performed in this room. 2.2 Cleaning and Organization Keep our work area clean and organized to avoid contamination, sample loss, and unreliable data. Keep benches organized and wipe with 70% ethanol after completing your work. Wear blue disposable gown when entering PRC room #532 and remove your gown when leaving. Pre-PCR hoods are treated with UV light after every use (usually the hood has a timer for 15 min). Be a good roommate: dispose of your waste, empty ice buckets, put reagents away. If something is left out - don‚Äôt work around it and accumulate junk. Replace the paper drop cloth as appropriate. Shared equipment, like pipettes should be returned to their ‚Äòhome‚Äô. Communal spaces have cleaning assignments and protocol on alternating Fridays. Decontamination Schedule. 2.3 Ordering supplies for the wetlab We use Quartzy to order reagents and lab supplies. If you can‚Äôt find it on Quartzy, send information( cat #, amnt, etc) in #ordering channel. Timelines can be days, weeks or months. Order in advance. 2.4 Receiving shipped samples üì¶ When any box of samples arrives, it must be immediately dealt with. Contact the person who arranged the shipment and is waiting for the samples to let them know it has arrived and what temperature to store the samples at. If they are not onsite, discuss who will perform the following steps: Open the incoming shipments key, add a line for the items, and link it to the file in Box (login and generate a link). The key must be done immediately, this is how we know what we have received. Add notes indicating how you handled the samples, and who will be updating Sample DB within 48 work hours. Upload the samples into SampleDB within 48h of arrival. 2.5 Receiving other supplies When any box arrives, make sure it is dealt with. Reagents and supplies may be temperature sensitive. Get them in the correct storage condition (usually found on the box/container, and if not on the reagent itself), and notify the owner. Add your name and date on packing slip, put on Charles‚Äô bench. 2.6 Sequencing Next Generation Sequencing is an integral part of our work at the EPPIcenter. To keep data reliable and accurate while sequencing thousands of samples, please keep the following things in mind. To keep track of samples and linked metadata we have the following guidelines. Before every sequencing library prep, fill out an experimental plan detailing what sequencing indexes you are using. Since we may sequence thousands of samples at a time, it is important to coordinate what indexes you are using with other experiments that may be sequenced in the same run using the index inventory (you must avoid overlap). Once you finish preparing your samples for sequencing, coordinate with other members of the lab to get a superpool ready for sequencing using the EPPIseqpools sheet. 2.7 Lab Notebook üìñüåê We use Benchling, a digital lab notebook to keep track of experiments. Detailed and properly labeled notes are vital to keeping track of samples and data. Our standards for naming each experiment can be found here. You may use a physical notebook as well, but all entries should conform to our lab notebook guidelines. UCSF owns your notebook. If you want to keep a copy, use one that makes copies as you go. 2.8 SampleDB Our sample tracking database, in which all samples in the lab can be found. This includes micronics tubes with extracted DNA/plasma/serum/etc, cryovials, and dried blood spots. When you move from one sample type to another (for example, extracting DNA from DBS into micronics tubes), the information about those samples must be linked to the samples and the micronics plate scanned into SampleDB on that day. In addition, when samples are moved from plate to plate or box to box, plate maps or box maps should be updated immediately. Ensure the samples are linked to the proper study, and follow the naming guidelines for the study. (guidelines here.)

For example, library contaminations can easily cost over $10,000 only in sequencing run reagents. Samples collected in the field, and some generated in our lab, cannot be replaced and contamination could make whole projects unviable. Contamination is not always easy to spot, and months (or more) of work may be lost if contamination is not prevented or detected promptly. In conjunction with mislabeling and poor note taking, contamination is hard to detect and could lead to misleading results and ultimately retraction of published studies. For these reasons, extra care needs to be taken when working with samples in our lab. Contamination can happen at various levels, and some examples include: Raw samples: blood spots contaminated with blood from other samples, or nucleic acids or other macromolecules extracted and concentrated. Extracted macromolecules: extracts cross-contaminated with extracts from other samples, or with concentrated extracts or reaction products DNA libraries: one of the most likely, as DNA is very concentrated in these reactions and cross-contaminations can lead to high concentration of contaminants Reagents: where reagents, including water, master mixes, and others, are contaminated with exogenous molecules Equipment and consumables: all equipment and surfaces can be contaminated. This includes pipets, boxes of tips, magnetic racks, etc. You: we work with human samples and thus, each of us is a potential contaminant. This is most critical in studies where information from humans (as opposed to pathogens) is retrieved. To avoid contamination, the following measures are required: Physical separation of XNA-free, pre-PCR and PCR areas to avoid PCR amplicon and XNA contamination at all costs. (see above) Reagents/materials move unidirectionally (XNA-free ‚Üí pre-PCR ‚Üí PCR). Nothing goes back, including pipets, ice buckets, reagents, etc. XNA is completely XNA-free, with the exception of oligos/primers. Pre-PCR is completely free of amplicons (from any reaction that amplifies DNA) and their products. No exceptions. No temporary storage. Importantly, PPE also should follow this unidirectional flow. E.g, do not bring gloves from PCR to Pre-PCR. Equipment and materials are dedicated to each room and they should be clearly labeled as such. Reagents and consumables to be used in XNA-free or Pre-PCR need to be taken to those rooms directly after receiving. Exceptions: Ice. A dedicated ice bucket can leave the XNA room. It should be held with one hand and the other hand can be used to pour ice into the bucket. Ice and cold racks to transport samples in the unidirectional flow. Racks should be taken into the next ‚Äòlevel‚Äô only when necessary and should not be touched with potentially contaminated PPE. They should be placed over a paper towel or other non-potentially contaminated material and not directly on the surfaces. And they should be taken back to their room as soon as possible and with clean gloves. Rotation of index primers so the same indices are not used twice in a short period of time. This will help identifying potential contaminations Workstations and surfaces should be wiped with 70% ethanol before and after use All reagents should be aliquoted into single-use tubes when possible. Or as close to single-use as possible. Change gloves frequently to avoid cross-contaminations If splashes occur, decontaminate the surface/instrument properly and promptly (see tab labeled ‚Äúinstructions‚Äù) Pay extra attention to pipetting and potential droplets jumping or dropping into other samples. If you notice that a piece of equipment is malfunctioning, let the lab manager (Charles Le) know as soon as possible, so that it can be fixed. This is especially important with multichannel and high throughput pipetting instruments where tips or liquids can drop.

If your work is too large to run on your own laptop or would benefit from a highly parallelized workload, Wynton should be used. Wynton Home How to get an account Log in without password (optional but useful) Learn about Wynton and Wynton tutorial Join Wynton slack (optional) Join bioinf_genepitools EPPIcenter Slack channel 3.1.1 Wynton Best Practices If you plan to use wynton, you should know about the following. 3.1.1.1 Login vs Development vs Data Transfer Nodes The login (log) node is where users can submit jobs or transfer to other nodes, such as development nodes. While submitting jobs to the job scheduler is okay, running software on these nodes is not advised. The development (dev) node is where users may run quick tests. This is also the node where you may access prepackaged software already available on wynton, or install your own software locally. You can access this node by signing into the login node, and then enter: ssh dev1 to log onto the dev node. There are multiple dev nodes so if dev1 is not available, there may be an alternative. The data transfer (dt) node should be used if transferring files to and from wynton. 3.1.1.2 Scratch Drive There is local (/scratch) and global (/wynton/scratch) scratch space. 3.1.1.2.1 Local Local scratch should be used to hold intermediate files produced by your scripts. This is a much faster drive space that is local to the node you are using to run your script. 3.1.1.2.2 Global Global scratch is accessible by all nodes and is where you should keep your large files or store results to be shared with others. To use this space, it is recommended to use the following command to create a folder with your username so that your work can be isolated from others: mkdir &quot;/wynton/scratch/$(whoami)&quot; As an example, if your username is jonsnow, you would now have a folder for your work under /wynton/scratch/jonsnow. 3.2 Aragorn Aragorn is a moderately powerful desktop computer housed in our lab (built in 2014) that can be used for small workloads. Generally, if you can run it on your relatively new laptop but don‚Äôt want to tie up using your computer, Aragorn is a good alternative. However, it is limited in its ability, and should only really be used for short term usage. Longer term jobs (up to 2 weeks) should be run on Wynton. How to access Aragorn/theMines Who to ask for account R Studio? At least one member should be responsible (ie. an admin) for Aragorn, in charge of adding users. For now ask our Bioinformatician, Brian Palmer Specs: Component spec Processor Intel i7-4770 RAM 16gb DDR3 Storage 250gb SSD + 1tb HDD Power Supply 430W 3.3 The Mines ‚õ∞Ô∏è The Mines are our network attached storage (NAS), essentially a small server with a very large amount of storage (~60 tb). Used for long term storage of raw data. Data is backed up nightly to an offsite location. 3.4 Nextflow Nextflow is a workflow language that can generate job submissions for many HPC scheduler platforms. Recommended for production level pipelines. An example is Sun Grid Engine, the scheduler currently used by Wynton HPC (Jan 2023). More information about Nextflow on their website. Example pipelines can be found under the EPPIcenter Organization on GitHub or at nf-co.re. 3.5 Installing software If you are using a shared resource, you will find that there are issues with insufficient privileges to install at the site level. You should instead install binaries locally. One package manager that is recommended is conda or miniconda3. Conda environment/ best practices (link somewhere) 3.6 Github A code repository where members of the EPPIcenter store pipelines, tools and analysis. GitHub enables collaboration and sharing projects under the EPPIcenter organization. Members are recommended to create a GitHub account and request access from one of the organization admins. 3.7 Docker Hub A repository for docker images, to store and share custom images. A user that needs access to the image can easily pull the image from the repository. Another use case is configuring nextflow to use docker, which will automatically pull a specified image. To learn more, please refer to the docker docs. 3.8 Stack Overflow for Teams A knowledge sharing platform for EPPIcenter questions and answers. Users are encouraged to post questions, tutorials, and answers. Additionally, when a user is stuck on a particular problem, they can search through the EPPIcenter Stack Overflow to seek a solution to their particular problem.
