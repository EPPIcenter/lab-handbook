# Getting Started {#getting-started}
When you sign your acceptance letter, UCSF gives you a start date. About 24 hours prior to your start date, Human Resources will send a long email that explains how to access your UCSF email & calendar (your UCSF identity). They will not activate these until midnight. The same email has instructions for both [UCSF](https://police.ucsf.edu/weid) & [ZSFG](https://wiki.library.ucsf.edu/display/ZSFG/SFDPH+HR+Badging+Office+Location+and+Contact+Information) badges, and building access. Follow their instructions to request your ZSFG badging letter. Pick up the letter and walk it to the ZSFG badging office.

## EPPIcenter Meetings 📅
There are several standing meetings on your Outlook calendar. Meetings specific to your role will also be added. Everyone attends the Friday meeting, Malaria Meeting, the monthly seminar.  Project specific meetings and 1:1 meetings with PIs may be standing, or scheduled as needed depending on PI’s preference. 

**Friday EPPIcenter meeting**
[Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YYfNd1G93Qqgbf2S-gDEu23JhrtJOm0FwskoDZGqwKc/edit?usp=sharing). We prefer you attend in-person. At the moment we share lunch (provided) on the 2nd Friday of the month. After announcements (abstract deadlines, events, new papers), a rotating subset of people will provide a 1-5 minute update on their research (and life, if they’d like!). Then the person assigned to present that day will discuss a research project or a paper for 40-45 minutes.  Announce papers early in the week to allow everyone to read and critically think about the paper.

**Monthly Seminar Series** All are expected to attend. These are curated experiences that bring you in contact with leaders in their field. The typical format is an hour-long talk (open to the general public) followed by 30 minutes of Q&A (closed to our lab only). As an example—Trevor Bedford kicked off the series *before* COVID made him famous. 

**Bay Area Malaria Meeting** [Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rbsZsF4s6FoEHHqlyF2kO6J3m0H74vyWXMsBcdol-AY/edit?usp=sharing). Brings you in contact with malaria researchers across multiple UCSF campuses and institutions. Convenes alternate Tuesdays.

**Wetlab meeting** Meets 9:30-10:30am Mondays to set the agenda for the week for wetlab projects.  [wetlab working doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K3uamBw6rDOgXE29ZmL0mdC_nzqp43c30sgeDOg8FTM/edit?usp=sharing). 

**Bioinformatics meeting** Wednesday at 2pm. This meeting is run by the bioinformaticians, attended by interested post-docs and PIs. It is a weekly meeting to update the progress made on various projects and to troubleshoot issues that have come up. Agenda: [here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1Cl3sZ0PCqAqWtUMfv-BUmU0FEouD1hpqjFK83k6Lyjg/edit)

**Lo Lab meeting** Every two weeks, typically Monday 10am every two weeks. Comprised of announcements and updates, followed by a presentation on a paper or some work in progress.
 

## Lab Communication
Each PI may have different preferences for their primary mode of communication,  please check with your supervisor. Members should add vacation/out days on the  [EPPIcenter Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=vb5mcl4ocpvcelcr9asemnofi4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles), so the group can plan.  

Slack is the primary mode of communication for the large EPPIcenter group, and the best tool for announcements and discussions. We are able to add collaborators as single-channel users, to hold discussions with a wider group. 

Asana <img src="./images/asana.png" width="20" /> is our primary tool for project management. You may be assigned tasks in Asana if your supervisor prefers.

**Slack** <img src="./images/slack.png" width="20" />
We love [EPPIcenter slack](https://join.slack.com/t/eppicenter/shared_invite/zt-jwk46vlu-OlEWxROxsjUIAZs33sz__w)!! We use it a lot. Please [review best practices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gGLzXYtGEE7kjkQlX4MU3LEk60P-QCi-eUBIas6nyvQ/edit?usp=sharing). Please do not create new direct message groups unless absolutely necessary; use a channel and include everyone involved. 

There is a “#where” channel on Slack, which is mostly for post-docs and PIs to let the team know when they will not be in person. If you are working from home, you do not have to tell us where you are or why you are working from home in the #where channel; we expect you to stay in contact with project leads, and we trust you to complete your work. If you would prefer to let people know, go ahead! 

[**UCSF Box**](https://it.ucsf.edu/how-to/box-drive) <img src="./images/box.png" width="20" />
Where we keep and share files securely. Access it at My Access. Download the Box Drive application to your device. It will save you headaches later.  Ask Teresa to invite you to EPPIadmin. There are other folders specific to different projects (PRISM, Serology etc..) You may need to remind your teammates that you need access.

**Zoom** <img src="./images/zoom.png" width="20" />
Download the [zoom app](https://it.ucsf.edu/service/zoom-web-conferencing) to your desktop. Login to your UCSF zoom account on My Access and set up your personal zoom room. Add your link to [our zoom rooms](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VmYGoXNkYjSO7IoD3dWUgJw1y8fKJUQm6ucRfu8AKL0/edit?usp=sharing).

## Ordering & Reimbursements (EPPIcard and MyExpense) 

- **MyExpense** [Instructions for reimbursement](https://supplychain.ucsf.edu/sites/supplychain.ucsf.edu/files/Submitting%20Your%20Expense%20Report%20in%20MyExpense.pdf). You need the speedchart (pinned in Slack #ordering) 
  - Edward Wiedemann is the approver for most grants. Add him to your account settings before start. 
  - To charge another PI’s grants, you need approver’s name and the full chartstring (not just speedchart)
  - Use the SAP concur app, and set up direct email forwarding of receipts to Concur.
  - Alcohol is difficult to get reimbursed;  keep it on a separate receipt when possible.
  - Reimbursement in UCSF is complicated. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. 


- **EPPIcard** when a speedchart won’t work. Get PI or Teresa’s approval. Details pinned in #ordering. Immediately record in [EPPIcard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R4dvfFYu_PS2yGAtvMxJmXffS3iTwL99c29NYJ4NMds/edit?usp=sharing) Put receipt in Box [EPPIcard invoices](https://ucsf.box.com/s/2flncs9a7djey8kwyun8qc1rcgevfky2). Do NOT use for travel (flights, hotels, or conf fees)

- **Travel** ✈️
Work travel includes travel for conferences and for on-site research supervision or training. There are two options for booking flights, through Connexus/UC Travel office (which charges a speedtype and automatically enrolls you in travel insurance) or on your own credit card with reimbursement after the trip ends. If the trip is being charged to a federal grant, you may be required to use a US Carrier depending on where you are flying: [Fly America Act](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/travel-management-policy/fly-america-act). You can use codeshare flights like Delta/KLM. If you book your flight independently, you must register for UC Travel insurance: [register](https://rmis.ucsf.edu/business-travel-insurance). 

  - Request a [travel cash advance](https://rmis.ucsf.edu/business-travel-insurance), and keep records of what you spend. Photo your receipts and forward them to [My expense](https://rmis.ucsf.edu/business-travel-insurance), either by email or through the Concur App. Our approver is Edward Wiedemann. Avoid paying other people’s expenses while traveling (lodging, food). It makes the reimbursement process more difficult. Alcohol is almost never reimbursable; put it on a separate receipt, or you will have to allocate the receipts to indicate that those items are personal expenses. 

  - **International travel:** Be sure to get [UCSF travel approval](https://coronavirus.ucsf.edu/sites/g/files/tkssra7486/f/International_Travel_Approval_%26_Resources_7.25.22.pdf), you will need it to get reimbursed. You need necessary vaccines, and get your visa ahead of time. Get malaria prophylaxis if you are traveling to an endemic country. Double check the dates on your visa once you get it to make sure you are not turned away at the airport. Make sure to [register](https://rmis.ucsf.edu/business-travel-insurance) for UC Travel insurance. 

**Other travel resources can be found here (link to additional stuff below)**

- Rules depend on funding. A [good guide](https://www.ucgo.org). [Best UCSF guide](https://supplychain.ucsf.edu/travel). Ed Wiedemann knows specifics for your grant
- Book flights thru Connexus or UC Travel office. This uses a speedchart and enrolls you in the insurance.
- If you use your credit card for flight manually [register](https://rmis.ucsf.edu/business-travel-insurance) for travel insurance (UC policy).
- Federal grants use a US carrier ([Fly America Act](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/travel-management-policy/fly-america-act)) (Delta/KLM is OK, book through Delta not KLM) 
- Request a cash advance in MyExpense if needed. Email budget to approver and have PI  email approval. 
- Make sure your immunizations are appropriate. Some take more than 1 shot, spaced apart. 
- Laptop: get a UCSF IT note saying the UCSF encryption software is legal if you are traveling to a country where customs examines computers for encryption. For travel to Uganda, you do not need this.
- It is possible to link your Uber account to MyExpense.
