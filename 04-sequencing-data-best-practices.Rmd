# Sequencing Data Best Practices ðŸ“Œ

*Where to put data, how does it link to metadata? How to manage old data?* 

SampleDB and its Data Manager Utility is currently still under construction ðŸš§. 
For now, please store raw sequencing data in the Mines following the following guidelines: 

## Raw sequencing data 
Please store raw sequencing data in the mines in the following format: 
`sequencing_data/YYYYMMDD/some_filename.gz`

### Folder names 
**Date**: The `YYMMDD` date should be the sequencing run start date

**Biohub**<br />
`YYMMDD_Sequencer_RunNumber_FlowCellSerialNumber`<br />
Example folder name: <br />
`221006_VH00444_149_AAATC37HV`<br />

**In-house:** Make the folder name manually and be diligent about removing or renaming erroneously demuxed data. Here we emulate the folder naming structure used by Biohub.<br /> 
`YYMMDD_Sequencer_RunNumber_FlowCellSerialNumber`<br />
Example folder name:<br /> 
`221006_MiniSeqRR_1`<br />
